# Biberconf

Tools, tweaks and configs for a Bash command line environment.

Biberconf includes:
- [bash-git-prompt: An informative and fancy bash prompt for Git users](https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt) (slightly modified version)
- [HSTR: Easily view, navigate and search your command history](https://github.com/dvorka/hstr) (slightly modified version)
- [pss: A power-tool for searching inside source code files](https://github.com/eliben/pss)
- [stderred: stderr in red](https://github.com/sickill/stderred)
- Recommended settings for Git, Vim, and the tools listed above
- Some useful Bash and Git aliases/scripts

Biberconf sets all your custom configurations into version-control.

## Requirements

Tested on Ubuntu.

```bash
sudo apt install vim meld kdiff3
sudo apt install highlight # for `ccat`
sudo apt install build-essential cmake # for `stderred`
sudo apt install automake gcc make libncursesw5-dev libreadline-dev # for `hstr`
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bibermann/biberconf.git ~/.biberconf
cd ~/.biberconf
./install_or_update.sh
```

## Update

The script fetches the latest changes, installs them and rebases your `custom` branch.

```bash
cd ~/.biberconf
./install_or_update.sh
```

## Deinstallation

```bash
cd ~/.biberconf
./uninstall.sh
```

## Features

### Terminal prompt

Like the following but with color coding:

```bash
#      ,- signal name or exit code from last command
#     |  ,- current working directory
#     | |             ,- current virtual environment
#     | |            |       ,- current Git branch
#     | |            |      |       ,- remote Git status
#     | |            |      |      |   ,- local Git status
#     | |            |      |      |  |
    INT ~/.biberconf myvenv master â†‘2 *3+2
20:08 $ |
#   |   |
#   |    `- cursor, aligned with the working directory text above
#    `- current time
```

### Bash history

Like the following but with colors. Within the screen you can type keywords to filter the list and select a line with the arrow keys:

```bash
- HISTORY - view:history (C-/) - match:keywords (C-e) - case:insensitive (C-t) - 1813/4853/4 ---
        mkdir -p /tmp/biber
        cd $_
        echo "some command" > test.sh
        chmod +x test.sh
        git clone https://github.com/bibermann/biberconf.git ~/.biberconf
        cd ~/.biberconf
        ./install_or_update.sh
 HSTR $ |
```

```bash
        mkdir -p /tmp/biber
        git clone https://github.com/bibermann/biberconf.git ~/.biberconf
        cd ~/.biberconf
 HSTR $ biber|
```

```bash
        git clone https://github.com/bibermann/biberconf.git ~/.biberconf
 HSTR $ biber clone|
```

- When starting a new terminal window, a snapshot of all past commands (including all commands issued in still opened terminal windows) is made. This command history then is available in HSTR.
- Each issued command is saved with the current date:
    - In the `~/.bash_history` without duplicates to better work with the `[Arrow-Up]` and `[Arrow-Down]` keys in the terminal prompt.
    - In `~/.hstr_histories/` with duplicates to give sense to the "ranking view" mode in HSTR.

Shortcuts:
- `[Ctrl] + [s]`: Start HSTR in "history view" mode.
- `[Ctrl] + [r]`: Start HSTR in "ranking view" mode.
- `[Ctrl] + [r]`: Start HSTR in "favorites view" mode.

### Available commands

- `ccat FILE [FILES...]`: Prints the file(s) with syntax highlighting.
    - Change theme in `ccat_theme.sh`.
        - Present favorite themes: `_ccat_test_selected_themes [TEST_FILE]`
        - Present all themes: `_ccat_test_all_themes [TEST_FILE]`
- `stderred COMMAND`: Executes the command, highlighting all output to stderr with red.
- `pss ARGS...`: Runs `pss` ignoring directories listed in `pss_ignore.sh`.
- `prettyjson`: Shortcut for `python -m json.tool`
- More aliases:
    - `git` (language set to english)
    - `alert` (see `config/bash-5-aliases.sh`)
    - `l`
    - `ll`
    - `la`

### Git aliases

- `git df [ARGS...]`: Like `git diff` but as minimal as possible. Perfect for an overview of all changes.
- `git lg [ARGS...]`: Like `git log --graph` but with pretty and compact formatting.
- `git alg [ARGS...]`: Auto-Log: Like `git lg` but in reverse order and automatically updating after changes. That means if you run this command once in a terminal and pin it somewhere on the screen, you will always see the up-to-date git history there, starting with the youngest entry at the bottom of the terminal window.
